Product Sales Forecaster

 Project Overview
The Product Sales Forecaster is a Python-based AI/ML project designed to predict product sales in Indian Rupees (INR) using linear regression. This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization, tailored for entry-level software engineering roles. It uses a synthetic dataset of product sales, processes it with pandas, stores data in SQLite, trains a linear regression model with scikit-learn, and visualizes results using Plotly. The project is optimized to run in Google Colab, making it accessible and easy to deploy.

This project was developed as part of my learning journey to build practical AI/ML solutions, showcasing skills relevant to roles like Software Engineer at MAQ Software.

 Features
- Data Management: Stores and retrieves sales data (in INR) using SQLite.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data using pandas for model training.
- Machine Learning: Implements linear regression to predict future sales based on historical data.
- Visualization: Generates interactive sales trend visualizations using Plotly.
- Colab Compatibility: Designed to run seamlessly in Google Colab with clear setup instructions.
- Error Handling: Includes robust checks for database and data processing errors.

 Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, SQLite, Plotly
- Environment: Google Colab
- Database: SQLite for lightweight data storage
